# SummerProject2021
Repository for our Summer Project

Every user has their own dedicated branch to store code, as well as this main directory holding the shared version of the code. 

The idea is that each of us can tinker and alter our own code, commit our own changes to then be reviewed by each other. 

Once we all agree on all or part of someone’s code being the preferred choice for our project, we can commit it to the shared repository on the main branch. 

Also, any external libraries (if any) we decide we need will be stored in the main branch. 

As we progress using this tool, code documentation should be a priority in my opinion. This way, when it comes time to review each other’s code, we can spend less time trying to communicate on a per message basis over discord, and have an easier time learning from each other with well documented and collected notes. 

Here is a link to github’s guides.

It will also be posted in the group discord, as well.
